<h4>Project Proposal</h4>
<p>We plan to utilize the information that we are obtaining during Sprint 6 making Matchmaker on
    a website that will allow you to find the best career path for you between Aviation, Nursing,
    and Computer Science.</p>
<h4>Priority Features</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>Website accessible through a domain name</li>
    <li>A comprehensive list of questions to determine a compatible career path</li>
    <li>Have the Matchmaker program run on the website</li>
</ul>
<h4>Secondary Features</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>A complex weighting system that allows for multiple desired answers</li>
    <li>Have a functioning validate function</li>
    <li>Record the data from users</li>
    <li>Display the top results on the site</li>
</ul>
<h4>Languages and Platforms Utilized</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>Python3</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>GoDaddy</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<h4>Technical Features Being Utilized</h4>
<p>We did not realize that combining the Matchmaker application and a website was the focus of
    Sprint 6. However, we stil plan to create this project as we will be learning in class. The
    additional features are creating a Domain name for our website as well as keeping track of
    the data from users. We also hope to display a list of the top user results.</p>
