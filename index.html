<h4>Project Proposal</h4>
<p>We plan to utilize the information that we obtained during Sprint 4 making Matchmaker to create
    a website that will allow you to find the best career path for you between Aviation, Nursing,
    and Computer Science.</p>
<h4>Priority Features</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>Website accessible through a domain name</li>
    <li>A comprehensive list of questions to determine a compatible career path</li>
    <li>Have the Matchmaker program run on the website</li>
</ul>
<h4>Secondary Features</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>A complex weighting system that allows for multiple desired answers</li>
    <li>Have a functioning validate function</li>
</ul>
<h4>Languages and Platforms Utilized</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>Python3</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>GoDaddy</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
</ul>
<h4>Languages and Platforms Utilized</h4>
<p>We are going to build upon the Matchmaker program we already made in Sprint 4 as well as the website we
    created in Sprint 2. The programming that goes beyond what we have learned is combining the the two
    projects and provinding a domain name</p>
